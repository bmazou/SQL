use HotelDatabase;


/*
For reference, the schema is drawn out in the 'schema.jpg' file.

The database is of a hotel chain, currently starting with a single small hotel, trying to expand and add more locations in the future.

Each Hotel has its Employees, that have their JobType (i.e. receptionist, room service etc.).

Each Hotel also has Rooms, that also have their RoomType (maximum capacity and how much they cost).

Guests can make Reservations and choose want Room they want,  want type of Board they want (none, half, full, all-inclusive), the time range of their stay, and how many people are coming.

Guests need to be registered in the database before making a reservation.

The database checks, whether the chosen Room is free during desired period of the stay. It also checks that the number of guests coming doesn't exceed the rooms capacity.

After a Reservation is created, the database automatically generates a Bill linked to the Reservation, while calculating how much the total stay will cost, depending on the length of stay, chosen Room, and chosen Board.
Guests can also delete or change their reservations.
